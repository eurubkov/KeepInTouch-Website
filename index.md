## Welcome to Keep In Touch (KIT)
Never lose a friend again!

### About

How many times have you thought that you haven't talked to someone and that you need to send them a text or an email, and then quickly forgot about doing it because a busy life got in a way? 
"Keep In Touch" attempts to solve this problem by letting you choose the contacts you want to be reminded of and how often. And when a notification arrives, you can quickly call or text them.

### Privacy

Keep In Touch will need access to your contacts list and that's it! We never know who your contacts are and all the magic happens inside your phone - nothing goes to the internet, so we won't know anything about you or your friends. We hate spammers, scammers and whoever else gains and treats our data irresponsibly, and since we have no access to your data - you can make sure it won't leave your phone.
